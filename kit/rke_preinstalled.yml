## This is an Kit example of RKE cluster with preinstalled Ubuntu nodes.
##
## Preconditions:
## - Users need to preinstall a set of nodes with Ubuntu systems.
## - Before running the "init" command, users need to:
##     - Input the IP addresses of the nodes in the "Parameters - nodes" config section.
##     - Input the user names to login the nodes in the "Parameters - nodes" config section.
##     - Input the password of the nodes or a ssh key to access the nodes in the "Parameters - nodes" config section.
##
## Features:
## - The "cluster deploy" can be run in an offline mode (no external network connection needed).
## - The offline "service deploy" is not supported.

Use:
##import the configs set in common.yml
- kit/common.yml

Parameters:
  customconfig:
    registry:
      ## set the password before running the command of "./conductor init -c *.yml"
      password: 

  ##nodes field contains a list of node objects.
  ## the below is a two-nodes cluster with one node supporting both controlplane and etcd and 
  ## one node supporting node.
  nodes:
  - ip:
    role:
      - controlplane
      - etcd
    user:
    ssh_key_path: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  - ip:
    role:
      - worker
    user:
    ssh_key_path: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ##labels:
  ###  - name:
  ###    value:
  ## to add a work (or controlplane) node by setting a group of attributor as below. 
  ## controlplane node is at least 1 and up to 3.
  ## ## Controlplane:
  ## - mac:
  ##  ip:
  ##  role:
  ##    - controlplane
  ##    - etcd
  ##  user: sys-admin
  ##  ssh_passwd:
  ##  (or ssh_key_path: ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
  ##
  ## ## Worker:
  ## - mac:
  ##  ip:
  ##  role:
  ##    - worker
  ##  user: sys-admin
  ##  ssh_passwd:
  ##  (or ssh_key_path: ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
